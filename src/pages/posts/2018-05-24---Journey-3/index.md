## Sequences

We established in my [last post](/posts/journey-2/) that my self study adventure will take approximately 2 years to complete if I study 16 hours a week.

But it's a little more complicated than that. The classes are organized into different subjects and usually depend on other classes. Organizing the pre-requisite dependencies into __sequences__, we have the following:
#### Coding
38 weeks
```
How to Code - Simple Data 7 weeks
How to Code - Complex Data 6 weeks
Software Construction - Data Abstraction	6 weeks
Software Construction - Object-Oriented Design	6 weeks
Software Engineering: Introduction	6 weeks
Software Development Capstone Project	7 weeks
```
#### Languages
10 weeks
```
Programming Languages, Part A	4 weeks
Programming Languages, Part B	3 weeks
Programming Languages, Part C	3 weeks
```
#### Math and Theory
83 weeks
```
Calculus 1A: Differentiation 13 weeks
Calculus 1B: Integration 13 weeks
Calculus 1C: Coordinate Systems & Infinite Series	13 weeks
Mathematics for Computer Science1	13 weeks
Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part I	8 weeks
Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part II	8 weeks
ops-class.org - Hack the Kernel	15 weeks
```
#### Systems
12 weeks
```
Build a Modern Computer I 6 weeks
Build a Modern Computer II 6 weeks
```
#### Applications
41 weeks
```
Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers 15 weeks

(in any order)

Machine Learning 11 weeks
Introduction to Computer Science with Python 9 weeks
Databases	12 weeks
Cryptography I 6 weeks
Introduction to Computer Networking	8 weeks
Computer Graphics	6 weeks
```
