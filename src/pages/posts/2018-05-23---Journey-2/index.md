## The Time Frame

As you might have read in my [last post](/posts/starting-out), I want to be more better edukated with [these open source computer science classes.](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). This is a huge commitment. I will need to act as my own professor, advisor and career counselor all at once.

So, I slipped between the Google Sheets to help get an idea of the scope of this undertaking. The estimated __minimum__ number of hours to complete the program is __1606.3__. Why minimum? I think I'll come in closer to the minimum because I already have some experience in the industry. In fact, a lot of early classes, I will be learning notation and the "academic way" of thinking about things I already have experience with. Full disclosure, I have also taken Precalculus and Calculus 1 within the last 2 years in formal college classrooms.

1606.3 hours is around 144 days if I work for 12 hours straight and never take a day off.[If I took holidays and weekends off](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/workdays.html?d1=23&m1=5&y1=2018&d2=18&m2=12&y2=2018&), it would take 210 days. From the date of this posting that means I'll be done exactly one week before Christmas. (yey)

Let's say, and this is purely hypothetical, that I have a life and a full time job. That means I would probably only have time to consistently do four 4 hour sessions during the week. This gives me the chance to work it all out during the week or put things off until the weekend if I need to. This limits me to __16 hours a week__.

1606.3 total hours / 16 hours per week = about 100 weeks. [100 weeks from today puts me at April 21, 2020](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=5&d1=23&y1=2018&m2=4&d2=21&y2=2020&ti=on). So, __about 2 years__... going by the *minimum* hour requirement.

Does this make me feel discouraged? At first glance, hells yeah. But at second glance, 2 years isn't that much time. 2 years ago, I was the same person I am today. I had the same dreams about going to school that I have today. In fact, I did take a few online classes that I never finished. Do I appreciate the work that I did 2 years ago? hells yeah. Will I appreciate this work in 10 years? 100%.

## Up Next

I'll be looking at what the course menu is and which order I'll be taking the classes. Continue to stay tuned!
