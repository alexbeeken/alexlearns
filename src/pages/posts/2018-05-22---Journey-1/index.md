## Backstory

For my full tragic backstory, you can checkout the About page.

For the busy, a TL;DR of my working life: I was a high school teacher then a Software Engineer for 2 years. I studied CS through cs50 on Edx and then went to a code school. This caused some pain and frustration because I was essentially a noob wielding a level 50 sword.

## Frontstory

Now, I am less of a noob but wielding less of a sword. I currently have a contract but no full time job. My burden is light, my future is bright and it's time to make good on my word: I have been saying for years that I want to go back to school to study computer science.

This requires money though and money is something that I could have if I was boring. You know, if I kept a job for more than 3 years like an adult. But life is to be lived! I've just been too excited about the potpourri of experiences this world has to offer to spend my days chained to a desk... for more than 2 years at a time.

Enter the OSSU (bows down on the floor in prayer.)

Last week, in a stroke of genius, I googled "How to Get a Free Computer Science Degree" and came across this [github repo](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). Apparently, the OSSU put together this guide to getting a complete education in computer science through free online courses and , hey look, cs50 is on there. Well, my programming roots are in MOOCs and I love free education.

## The Quest

I have decided I am going to complete the OSSU computer science tract and become a self made Bachelor of Computer Science.

No, really though. This is something I've wanted for years and I strongly believe in free education. MOOC learning is better on almost every level except for a few small details like:

- FACE TO FACE INTERACTION
- ACCOUNTABILITY

Oh shoot. This might be harder than I thought. As an independent contractor, I understand how challenging it is to manage myself. I am moody. I am easily distracted. I go through random episodes of mild mania and not as mild depression. I am very motivated by face to face interaction and I am certainly not someone who always finishes what they start.

It's not all bad though. I've learned a few tricks.

## Self Management

This will take a lot of self management. It will probably take every trick I have ever used to help me stay on track used in conjunction for me to complete this. The road is long, dark and full of enemies but so am I!

Some tricks of the trade:

1. __This Blog__ writing and sharing what I'm learning is going to help me feel accountable, give me a place to vent and let me practice some creative writing.

2. __Videos__ I love making videos. It would be really fun to make some videos just sharing cool things that I'm learning and if people watch it then BOOM that counts as human interaction doesn't it?

3. __A Big Whiteboard__ my roommate bought me a huge whiteboard last year that sits permanently fixed to my wall next to my bed. I LOVE IT.

4. __Todo Lists__ you know the feeling when you scratch an itch? That's what checking a box feels like on a todo list.

5. __Coffee__ a little caffeine in the morning is the best feeling ever. A lot of caffeine in the morning makes my fingers tingly and I get panic attacks.

6. __Spiral Notebooks__ the original Google Docs.

7. __iPad Pro__ OneNote on iPad is best of both OS worlds.

8. __Spotify__ To drown out loud teenagers and phone talkers in the coffeeshops.

9. __Coffee Shops__ when I need some new music for my Spotify.

10. __Twitter__ I don't like twitter but it might be a good way to find other people doing what I'm doing.

11. __Supplemental Materials__ taking the time to go more into depth will make the whole experience better.

12. __Explainer Videos__ one of the best things to happen to education in the last 10 years.

13. __Golden Hours__ those first 4 hours of every work day are precious. I have to make sure they are not wasted.

14. __Healthy Food__ to make sure my brain functions.

## The Next Steps

There are __27 courses__ in this program. In my next post I'll be outlining my plan of attack. Stay tuned!
