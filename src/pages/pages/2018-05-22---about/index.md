January 2014 was when I decided that I wanted to become a computer programmer. I was teaching high school and hating it. I was bad at it. I was unhappy. Every week I was just waiting for Friday so I could go to the bar and drink with the embarrassingly few friends that I had. At some point over winter break, I decided to take [cs50 on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)... again. I had started on it the year before out of curiosity but never actually finished.

This time I was actually determined to finish it and I did. It took me about 5 months of pretty intense night/weekend study but I finished it. Well, technically I didn't. There was a problem with one of my assignment submissions that somehow I couldn't fix. Even though I have no certificate to prove that I completed every assignment, I had a great experience with this course. It was my first MOOC. It was funny, exciting and paced very thoughtfully for newbies.

My original plan from here was to get a part time job and go to Oregon State University. I even applied and got in. But the old code school promise of a job in 4 months was too good to pass up. So I attended [Epicodus in Portland, OR](http://www.epicodus.com) in Winter of 2015.

After that I worked for 2 years as a Junior Software Engineer and Software Engineer. It was mostly challenging in a fun way but there were times where it was challenging in a less fun way. There were times when Google wasn't able to help me. These moments of deep deep confusion were difficult for me to handle. Despite 4 months of full time training and a year and a half of hobby coding, I was felt useless. Supply and demand got me the job but it didn't change the learning curve.

It got better. I improved but I ended up voluntarily quitting after 2 years. I was out of debt and wanted to flex my freedom wings and work for the Mono Lake Committee. I wasn't sure I would still want to code after quitting. While working, I had so many hobbies. I wrote music, sang in choirs, went running, learned to climb, started a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtZ04kW3xThhfO4PCfvGaNQ), took classes at [Open Signal](https://www.opensignalpdx.org/) and did some improv comedy jams.

But when I moved away, I found myself coding all the time... and not in a "oh shoot, I need to get another tech job" sort of way. I was enjoying it. Why was I enjoying it so much? Well, with no team to lean on, I was tasting the sweet sweet nectar of independence for the first time in a long time. You see, the Mono Lake Committee is located in Lee Vining. Lee Vining is a "city" of 400 people seated right outside the East Entrance to Yosemite. Sometimes I was just lucky to have wifi. This forced me to really take time and thoroughly learn... and to always setup a comprehensive offline dev environment.

I moved back to Portland in Fall of 2017 where I've been working on personal projects and gaining more independence as a programmer. One of the things I worked on is the social email service: [Spotlife](http://www.splotlife.club).
